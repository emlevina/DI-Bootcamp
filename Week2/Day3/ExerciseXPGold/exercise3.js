// Requirements : Donâ€™t use built-in Javascript methods to answer the following questions. You have to create the logic by yourself. Use simple for loops.

// 1. Console.log the sum of all the numbers in the age array.
let sum = 0;
for(num of age){
    sum +=num
}
console.log(sum)
// 2. Console.log the highest age in the array.
let max = 0;
for(num of age){
    max = num > max ? num : max 
}
console.log(max)
