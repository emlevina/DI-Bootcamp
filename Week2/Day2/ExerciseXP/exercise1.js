// Create 2 variables, x and y. Each of them should have a different numeric value.
// Write an if/else statement that checks which number is bigger.
// Example :

let x = 5;
let y = 2;

// You should display:
// x is the biggest number

if(x > y){
    console.log('x is the biggest number')
} else if (y > x) {
    console.log('y is the biggest number')
} else {
    console.log('x and y are equal')
}
