                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>Thanos is a mutant member of the race of superhumans known as the Titanian Eternals. The
                        character possesses abilities common to the Eternals, but amplified to a higher degree through a
                        combination of his mutant–Eternal heritage, bionic amplification, mysticism, and power bestowed
                        by the abstract entity, Death. Demonstrating enormous superhuman strength, speed, stamina,
                        immortality and invulnerability among other qualities, Thanos can absorb and project vast
                        quantities of cosmic energy, and is capable of telekinesis and telepathy. He can manipulate
                        matter and live indefinitely without food, air or water, cannot die of old age, is immune to all
                        terrestrial diseases, and has high resistance to psychic assaults. Thanos is also an
                        accomplished hand-to-hand combatant, having been trained in the art of war on Titan.</p>

                    <h2>Brother</h2>
                    <p>Eros is the youngest son of two Eternals, A'Lars and Sui-San. Eros grew up to be a fun-loving,
                        carefree womanizer in contrast to his brother Thanos, a power-hungry, misanthropic schemer. Only
                        when Thanos launched his first major attack against Titan, an attack that left their mother
                        Sui-San dead, did Eros begin to take life a bit more seriously.</p>

                <section id="children">
                    <h2>Children</h2>
                    <p>His most famous child is the assassin, Gamora. She isn’t one of his biological children, rather
                        he adopted her and raised her as his own to serve as his right hand.
                        <br><br>
                        He also has a son, Thane. Thane is the secret Inhuman son of Thanos. After a descendant Inhuman
                        tribe ran afoul of Thanos and his army, one Inhuman woman returned home pregnant with Thanos'
                        child. Thane grew to adulthood and became a healer among his people. When Thanos eventually came
                        looking for him, he underwent Terrigenesis and developed powers, and an appearance similar to
                        his father’s. One of his new powers enabled him to trap Thanos in amber, ensuring the Mad Titan
                        was trapped in a state between life and death.
                        <br><br>
                        He has had other children, including Rot, a child he fathered with Death. He has succeeded in
                        killing many of them, however.
