// Using this object:

const students = [
    { name: "Ray", course: "Computer Science", isPassed: true },
    { name: "Liam", course: "Computer Science", isPassed: false },
    { name: "Jenner", course: "Information Technology", isPassed: true },
    { name: "Marco", course: "Robotics", isPassed: true },
    { name: "Kimberly", course: "Artificial Intelligence", isPassed: false },
    { name: "Jamie", course: "Big Data", isPassed: false }
];
// Using the filter() method, create a new array, containing the students that passed the course.

const studentsPassed = students.filter(student => student.isPassed)
studentsPassed.forEach(student => {
    console.log(`Good job ${student.name}, you passed the course in ${student.course}`)
})
console.log(studentsPassed)
// Bonus : Chain the filter method with a forEach method, to congratulate the students with their name and course name (ie. “Good job Jenner, you passed the course in Information Technology”, “Good Job Marco you passed the course in Robotics” ect…)
